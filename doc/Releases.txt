Paper:            RockDB + New downloads 

Todo:             Versioning of data, client vs server.
                  Mirror downloads (get all latest files
						of whatever is already installed).

SWI:              Harmonization of bdb and rocks db ? 
                  Rocks allows aliases.
						Duplicate option for rocksdb.
						Rocks doesn't have mode (and does not open as read only so no 2 processes can open the db?)
						Would be nice to have the "correct" types when opening
						an existing database with no options.
						Rocks: Enumerate connections ? rocks_current(X).
